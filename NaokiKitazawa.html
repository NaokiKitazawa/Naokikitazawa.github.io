<h2>Major </h2>
<br>
Mathematics: geometry and application of geometry and mathematics to science and technology.<br>
1 Geometry of (differentiable) manifolds. <br>
- The singularity theory of differentiable maps: the global singularity theory. <br>
- Algebraic topology and differential topology of manifolds: applications of the global singularity theory. <br>
- Reeb graphs and Reeb spaces, which are defined as the spaces of all connected components of preimages of smooth maps and fundamental and important tools in the theory. <br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08841">A related paper recently accepted by Topological Methods in Nonlinear Analysis after a refereeing process.</a> <br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04340">A related paper: a positive referee report for publication has been announced and this will be published in Methods of Functional Analysis and Topology.</a> <br>
2 Topology of polyhedra. <br>
- Topological theory of graphs and spaces useful in the global singularity theory before. <br>
3 Applications of mathematics (I am studying as a beginner). <br> 
- Projections or mappings of figures and spaces to lower dimensional spaces, which are fundamental methods in geometry, and
 application to data analysis, machine-learning and various branches of science and technology. <br>
